# Spotify Log In Flow Refactor Documentation

## "Problem"

Recreate the login flow from spotify.com using JavaScript
  
- When a user visits the Spotify page, it starts with an Overlay
- Then, when they click the "Log In" button it takes them to a login form
- A user must fulfil certain username and password restrictions
- Upon meeting the username and password restrictions, the user is directed to the home page.

## Solution
### My Approach:

1. I outlined all of the tasks to be completed (Jira)
2. I created the HTML and CSS for overlays (tailwindcss)
3. I created the pseudo code outline of the project
4. I worked through each of the steps of the login flow in JavaScript

### Tools:
- PhpStorm IDE for production
- HTML, Tailwind CSS framework, JavaScript
- GitHub for collaboration / version control
- Jira for progress documentation
- Vercel for publishing the final product


### Results:

I completed the two separate overlay actions, and am still working on completing the username and password limit verifications.
